This is my first step into the 42 course journey.

C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to the highly usefulstandard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work,implementing and learning to use them. 
Your will create your own library. It will behelpful since you will use it in your next C school assignments.

Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year. However, when workingon a new project, don’t forget to ensure the functions used in your library are allowed inthe project guidelines
